# sisyphus

> [\[discord\]](https://discord.gg/uWWzUY4dQA) Modding framework for ULTRAKILL.

sisyphus is a simple modding framework and API for ULTRAKILL, designed to last[^1].

sisyphus uses UnityDoorstop to load itself before the game is loaded. BepInEx may be loaded alongside sisyphus, as sisyphus will auto-detect a BepInEx install and act accordingly.

[^1]: A futile effort, is it not?
