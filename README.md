> [\[discord\]](https://discord.gg/uWWzUY4dQA) Modding framework for ULTRAKILL.

sisyphus is a simple modding framework and API for ULTRAKILL, designed to last[^1].

## What it is.

sisyphus is (or at least will be) a bare-bones modding API and mod loader for ULTRAKILL, leveraging BepInEx for the base loading and pre-patching window.

Mods loaded through sisyphus should not expose themselves to the BepInEx API and should remain wholly loader-agnostic.

## What it isn't.

An exhaustive API. A feature-set framework for adding new content. You get the idea.

[^1]: A futile effort, is it not?
